# Legal Name/Gender Changes on Public Records


## California

#### Official State Support
The State of California allows you to change your name and gender, and has a well documented process with a how-to guide: https://www.courts.ca.gov/genderchange.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en

The filing fees are $435, but you may apply for a waiver if you cannot afford this.

## North Carolina
### Wake County
Acquire the following documents: https://www.lgbtcenterofraleigh.com/adult-programs/transgender-initiative/changing-your-name.html

##### For Background Checks...
* Go to the Detention Center at 3301 Hammond Road and get 2 fingerprint cards from the CCBI. They cost $10 each, and they require _cash_. Bring $20. Note: Most instructions say to go to the Sheriff’s Department. In Wake County, they no longer do it downtown but instead at the Detention Center.
* Send one of the fingerprint cards to the FBI along with:
  * $14 certified check or money order payable to the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation
  * Right to Review form, filled out
  * Identification. Copies of birth certificate and ID are accepted.

* Go to https://www.edo.cjis.gov/#/ and fill out the form, then pay the $18 by credit card and send the other fingerprint card to the address they tell you, along with a printout the confirmation email they send.
Wait about 3 weeks for both to return. Using the website for the FBI results in both of them returning within a few days of each other.

For out-of-state birth certificates, find the appropriate steps here: https://transequality.org/documents

Go to the Wake County Courthouse, 12th floor, and sign in at the desk under “non-hearing”. Get a name change packet, as the appropriate forms are NOT available online. Full, complete, clear instructions are the first page in this packet.

Fill out the Notice of Intent to Change Name form and have the clerk stamp it.
Go down to Floor S and post the Notice of Intent to Change Name form on the bulletin board under the appropriate month.

Leave up for 10 full business days, not counting the day posted or the day removed.
Pull the Notice of Intent to Change Name form from Floor S and take it, as well as the results of both background checks and the notarized documents from the packet and take them back to floor 12. Sign in again under “non-hearing” and they’ll assist you. When everything’s correct, pay the $120 fee (cash, money order, or certified check) and they’ll provide the court order. This can take a couple hours.

North Carolina has a pesky law (§ 101-6) that only allows one court ordered name change, fortunately there have been a number of appeals made and name changes granted. This link links to a story that highlights both denials, appeals, and the approvals granted.
