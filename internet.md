### Google/Gmail
Information on how to change your name and other info may be found [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27442?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). Google appears to have made this process relatively straightforward.

As noted by a contributor: The best approach seems to be creating an email alias, and utilizing that. Your Google sign-in name canâ€™t be changed. If you want a fully fresh slate, you can create a new account and forward your old emails, but you cannot transfer purchases.
