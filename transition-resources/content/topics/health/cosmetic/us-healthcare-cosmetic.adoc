UNC Aesthetics Clinic â€“ The aesthetic clinic offers laser hair removal treatments, and specifically offers a lower cost option for the 6 laser hair removal treatments needed before surgery. Phone: (984) 215-6350. Please note that the clinic is temporarily closed due to COVID-19, however we can still place a referral for when they re-open.

Haute Hair Removal & Aesthetics in Cary offers both electrolysis and hair removal. Andrea Arnold is a licensed Aesthetician and has worked with our patients before.  https://www.hautehairremoval.com/. Please note, I am unsure how COVID-19 has affected this practice.
