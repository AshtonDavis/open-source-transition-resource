OpenSource Transition Resources

The sections of the document are stored in "topics", under the content folder. In each topic folder, there is a master include which is used to collate all the resources into a coherent piece of content. This is done so we can work on a section and then include it when it's publish worthy.

index.adoc - is the main document to build the PDF.
uk-guide.adoc - UK Specific version of the guide.
apac-guide-adoc - Australian Version.
